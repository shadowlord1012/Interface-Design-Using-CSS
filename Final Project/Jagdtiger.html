      <h3> The History of Jagdtiger asuf. B</h3>
      <p>Jagdtiger asuf. B is a German casemate-type heavy tank destroyer
        (Jagdpanzer) of World War II. It was built upon the slightly lengthened
        chassis of a Tiger II. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz.
        186.

        The 72-tonne Jagdtiger was the heaviest armored fighting vehicle
        (AFV) used operationally by any nation in WWII and the heaviest
        combat vehicle of any type to be produced during the conflict. It
        was armed with a 12.8 cm Pak 44 L/55 main gun which could out-range
        and defeat any AFV fielded by the Allied forces.

        It saw brief service in small numbers from late 1944 until the end
        of the war on both the Western and Eastern Front. Although 150 were
        ordered, only around 80 were produced. Due to an excessive weight and
        an underpowered drivetrain system, the Jagdtiger was plagued with
        mobility and mechanical problems. Three Jagdtigers survive in museums.</p>
