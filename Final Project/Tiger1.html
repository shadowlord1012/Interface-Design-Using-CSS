            <h3>The History of Pzkpfw. VI Tiger ausf. H1</h3>
            <img src="./img/Tiger%201%20B.jpg" alt="Tiger 1">
            <p>Pzkpfw. VI Tiger ausf. H1 was a German heavy tank of World War II that began operational duty in
                1942 in Africa and in the Soviet Union, usually in independent heavy
                tank battalions. It gave the German Army its first armoured fighting
                vehicle that mounted the 8.8 cm (3.5 in) KwK 36 gun (derived from the
                8.8 cm Flak 36, the famous "eighty-eight" feared by Allied troops).
                1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944.After August
                1944, production of the Tiger I was phased out in favour of the Tiger II.

                While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time,
                it has also been called overengineered,using expensive materials and
                labour-intensive production methods. In the early period, the Tiger was prone to
                certain types of track failures and breakdowns. It was expensive to maintain,
                but generally mechanically reliable. It was difficult to transport and vulnerable to
                immobilisation when mud, ice, and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved
                Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road wheels, often jamming them solid.</p>
