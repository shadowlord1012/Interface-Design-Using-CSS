            <p id="Tiger_1_Information">The Tiger I is an iconic tank of World War II. It became
                one of the most significant and successful tanks of the
                war. The history of the Tiger I dates back to 1942 when
                it was developed as a response to Germany's need to enhance
                its defensive capabilities against formidable enemy tanks,
                particularly the Soviet KV-1 and T-34 tanks.

                The Tiger I was characterized by its high firepower and
                strong armor, enabling it to survive on the battlefield
                against Allied tanks. Additionally, it featured a highly accurate
                and effective 88mm Kw.K.36 L/56 cannon, allowing it to destroy enemy
                tanks with great efficiency at long distances.</p>

            <p id="Stridsvagn_information">Stridsvagn 103c, also known as S-Tank, was a Swedish
                tank destroyer developed and produced during the Cold War (1967 - 1971).
                Strv 103C had a very low profile, providing it with the advantage of surprise and better camouflage. Its
                armament consisted of a 105mm main gun Bofors L/62,
                which was highly effective against enemy armored targets.</p>
