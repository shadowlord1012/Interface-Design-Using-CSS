    <h3>The History of the Stridsvagn 103 C</h3>
    <img src="./img/Stridsvagn%20103C%20C.png" alt="Stridsvagn 103 C" >
    <p>also known as the Alternative S and S-tank,
      is a Swedish Cold War-era main battle tank, designed and manufactured
      in Sweden."Strv" is the Swedish military abbreviation of stridsvagn,
      Swedish for tank (literally combat wagon, it also is the Swedish word for
      chariot), while the 103 comes from being the third tank in Swedish service
      to be equipped with a 10.5 cm gun.

      Developed in the 1950s, it was the first main battle tank
      to use a gas turbine engine and the only mass-produced tank
      since World War II to not use a turret besides the German
      Kanonenjagdpanzer.It has an unconventional design with a unique
      gun laying process: it is turretless with a fixed gun traversed
      by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension.
      The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on survivability
      and heightened crew protection level.</p>
