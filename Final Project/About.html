            <h2>About 3DPRCH</h2>
            <p>We are a small Start up company making our dreams into a reality. Start in early 2024 as a hobbyist of RC
            trucks and cars. we have decided to expand into more complex 3D printing. And this is how it all began</p>
            <p> Our mission is to bring together a new breed of RC Hobbyists. As RC owners ourselves. We know all too well about
            breaking parts on the trails or rock climbs or even those high speed runs. As starting repairing our own RC crawlers
            with 3D printed parts it got us thinking. What else could we print that would expand the world of RC hobbyist from just
            trucks, bashers, racers, airplanes, and boats. Thus RC Tanks came into play.</p>
            <p>Our RC Tanks, when bought already built, are built from High Quailty PLA and ABS plastics as well as brass components
            in track links. We use only the strong stainless steel screws, bolts and nuts to reduce the wear on complex components.
